MyTunes music library
Command Language Version 0.1 (Alpha) Sept 2019
Rev 1: 2019 10 08: change some song_id to track_id to reflect 
that playlists refer to tracks not songs i.e. title,composer etc.
Also modified the language to be consistent with the
insert_beatles_tracks_rev2.txt insert script

Rev 2: 2019 10 09
For consistency the delete commands have a -t version but the -s version still there
but annotated as DEPRECATED which means you should still implement it.

Rev 3: 2019 10 22 (OPTIONAL --YOU DON'T NEED TO SUPPORT THIS IN YOUR ASSIGNMENT)
Some of you suggested that we should be able to add tracks (representing and audio file) that is
is not yet associated with an album (recording). We've added an optional:
add -t track_id null song_id
Command
Also a version that allows the application to assign the track id automatically.
add -t ? null song_id
